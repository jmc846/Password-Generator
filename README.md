# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story
<!-- for (var i = 0; i < 128; i++) {
    // alert("Generated Password") -->
var lowerCase
var upperCase
var numeric
var specialCharacters
<!-- AS AN employee with access to sensitive data

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
var lowerAlphabet = ()
var upperAlphabet = ()
var specialCharacters =()
var numbers = ()
var generatedPassword = ()
var userPassword
var userPassword= Math.floor(Math.random(28)*generatedPassword.length);
var randomStyle = []
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security -->

need while loop

while(!validator) { passlength = parseInt(prompt("Please enter))
if (!is Nan(paslength))

}}
